	  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select

	  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
	  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
	  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
	  (/dev/agpgart) support if it is available for your platform.
