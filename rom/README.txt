Reborned Hybrid ROM and Kernel for SonyEricsson x10i/a
By FeraVolt.

== Installation ==
(If you have locked bootoader - ignore first step, you already have latest kernel built-in ROM package. You may probably want to install LB kernel if you don't have CWM6 recovery.)
1) Extract 'FeraKernel.ftf' from firmware package to '/flashtool/firmwares/' folder & Flash kernel from FlashTool. 
2) Boot-up to CWM6 recovery & just straightly install ROM following AROMA installation wizard. No need to manually mout or wipe something - everything is automized.
3) After installation, boot your phone, pass setup wizard and wait 2 minutes. Reboot again.
4) On second boot wait not less than 2 minutes again & reboot.
5) Done. Do a reboot after you configured your phone.

Thanks for choosing FeraLab.
Peace out!
